# This allow list is used to determine which save files will be loaded from the sd card
# as well as which save files will be mirrored to the sd card when the game saves.
# Remove preceding # to allow a file to be copied from sd to save
#
# Keep the minimum number of files (ideally just the ones you want to modify) in this list,
# ideally around 3 or 4. As game will crash when trying to copy too many saves from the
# sd card to the save data in a row.
